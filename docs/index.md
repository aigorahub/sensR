# sensPy Documentation

`sensPy` aims to replicate the functionality of the R package `sensR` in Python.
The library is under heavy development and currently implements a few core
utilities such as psychometric functions and a beta-binomial model.

Documentation for additional modules will appear here as they are completed.
For detailed plans see [../plan-to-port.md](../plan-to-port.md).
